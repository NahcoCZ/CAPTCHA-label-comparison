# CAPTCHA Label Comparison

## Introduction
This GitHub Repository is used for the purposes of our research paper **"CNN Image Classification Model Comparison between Single-label and Multi-label CAPTCHA Dataset"**

The research aims to compare the two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that we have trained on differing datasets.
- Multi-label dataset collected specifically for this research (also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nahcocz/multi-label-image-captcha))
- Single-label dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhailma/test-dataset)

## How to Use
To run our models through a [reCAPTCHA Demonstration Website](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo).  You will need to install Python and all the necessary packages to run the Python script file (`driverapp.py`).

All the required packages used throughout this research has been exported into the `requirements.txt` file which can be used to create a new Conda Environment.

After installing all the necessary requirements, you should be able to run the driverapp.py and test out the models.
